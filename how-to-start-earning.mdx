Begin your journey with Brilliant Coin, from setting up your wallet to staking your first $BRILL. This guide walks you through each step with direct links, whether you're new to crypto or just new to Base!

## Step 1: Set Up a Crypto Wallet

- Download and install MetaMask (browser or mobile app).
- It's your secure digital wallet for holding and interacting with crypto assets.

## Step 2: Add the Base Network to MetaMask

Once MetaMask is installed, connect it to the Base network:

Use Chainlist or manually add:

- **Network Name**: Base Mainnet
- **RPC URL**: https://mainnet.base.org
- **Chain ID**: 8453
- **Currency Symbol**: ETH
- **Block Explorer**: https://basescan.org

## Step 3: Bridge ETH to Base

If you only have ETH on Ethereum mainnet or another chain, use the official Base Bridge to move ETH onto Base.

## Step 5: Start Earning!

Go to the official Brilliant Coin staking page: **staking.brilliantcoin.xyz**

There, you can:

- **Zap In**: Instantly convert ETH into the correct $BRILL/$WETH LP tokens and stake them in one click.
- **Track rewards**: Monitor your APR, TVL, and compounding progress.

Once you're staked:

- Use the **Claim** function to withdraw earned $BRILL
- Or **Compound** to reinvest your rewards for exponential growth

The more you participate, the more the system rewards you.
