## ðŸ”¹ Token Details

Brilliant Coin is built for growth, not gimmicks. No team tokens. No taxes. No friction.

## âœ… Launch Philosophy

- **No team allocation** â€” 100% of tokens are distributed through the protocol and community.
- **No taxes** â€” All transactions are clean, maximizing LP efficiency and composability.
- **No artificial caps** â€” Emissions are tied to protocol growth, not arbitrary supply walls.

## ðŸ“Š Emissions Distribution

**Base Emissions:**
- **100%** to liquidity providers (stakers)

**Additional Emissions (minted on top):**
- **+5%** to Treasury
- **+5%** to Tier 1 Referrers
- **+3%** to Tier 2 Referrers  
- **+1%** to Tier 3 Referrers

This means for every 100 tokens distributed to stakers, an additional 14 tokens are minted for treasury and referrals (when applicable).
