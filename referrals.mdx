Invite others. Expand the network. Earn as they grow.

Brilliant Coin's referral system is designed to reward those who help build the ecosystem, not just with one-time bonuses, but with a continuous share of protocol success!

## 🤝 How It Works

When someone joins Brilliant Coin using your referral link and begins earning rewards, you receive a portion of their claimed rewards — automatically and transparently.

The system supports a 3-tier referral structure, distributing a portion of claimed rewards to upstream referrers:

The result? A total of 5% distributed across three tiers, paid directly in $BRILL when your referrals claim their earnings.

## 📈 Ongoing Yield, Not Just One-Time Bonuses

You earn rewards every time your referrals claim creating a powerful flywheel of community-driven growth. There are no extra steps or manual tracking, it's all handled on-chain.

## 🔗 How to Generate Your Referral Link

1. Visit **brilliantcoin.com**
2. Connect your wallet in the top right
3. Click the "Referral" button next to your wallet address
4. This opens your personal referral dashboard
5. Copy your referral link or code and share it!

Growth isn't linear. With Brilliant Coin, it's exponential and collaborative!
