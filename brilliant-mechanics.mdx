Smart capital. Designed for scale.

Brilliant Coin is built on a foundation of carefully engineered mechanics — designed to reward commitment, align incentives, and drive long-term protocol sustainability.

It's Hype. It's Architecture.

## 💰 Rewards System

Participants stake v2 LP tokens (paired with WETH) into the Brilliant Protocol and earn $BRILL rewards — emissions designed to scale with Total Value Locked (TVL).

The more you stake, the more you earn.

APR begins at 100% when TVL reaches $25K, and doubles every time TVL doubles.

Rewards are distributed through a smart emissions split:

- **100%** to liquidity providers

## ⚠️ Claim Fee (Sustainability Mechanism)

### Mechanism:

Brilliant Coin charges an **8% claim fee**.

- The fee is not deducted from your staked LP but is applied at the moment of claiming rewards.
- The fee is paid in ETH (on Base) at the time of claiming.
- This ensures rewards remain fair for long-term stakers and supports protocol health.

### Fee Allocation:

- **50%** → Treasury (protocol growth & stability)
- **50%** → Lottery (community engagement & rewards)

### ✅ Example Calculation

- Pending rewards: $100 worth of $BRILL
- Claim fee = 8% of $100 = $8
- ETH price = $4,800 per ETH
- $8 ÷ $4,800 = 0.00167 ETH

So, to claim $100 in $BRILL rewards, you must also send 0.00167 ETH as the claim fee.

## 🧮 Additional Emissions

In addition to the base 100% emissions for stakers, the protocol also mints:

- **+5%** to Level 1 Referrer
- **+3%** to Level 2 Referrer  
- **+1%** to Level 3 Referrer
- **+5%** to the Treasury

If no referrer exists at a given level, that portion is not minted, preserving emission integrity.

## 📈 Brilliant Example (APR vs TVL)

APR scales in direct proportion to protocol depth, a design that rewards collective growth.

## 🔐 Smart Contracts

Our contracts are original, audited, and designed for both performance and transparency. Every interaction — from staking to rewards — is fully automated and verifiable on-chain.

The Brilliant Coin Protocol isn't just Brilliant — it's trustless by design.
