## 💡 What Makes Brilliant Coin Unique?

Brilliant Coin combines high-yield mechanics with architectural clarity.

Its TVL-linked APR structure, frictionless Zap-In onboarding, and multi-tier referral system create a self-reinforcing growth engine — all built on-chain and trustless.

## 📈 How Do I Earn the Most with Brilliant Coin?

Stake early. Compound consistently. Invite others.

Your APR increases as protocol TVL grows, and compounding your rewards amplifies long-term gains.

You can also earn passively through the referral system, which pays out a percentage of rewards every time your referrals claim.

Use the Zap-In feature for instant staking and stay engaged for maximum rewards.

## 🔐 Is Brilliant Coin Secure?

Yes. Security and transparency are core to the protocol.

- All smart contracts are independently audited
- There are no team wallets, no presales, and no taxes
- All mechanics are visible and verifiable on-chain

## 🔄 Is There a Max Supply?

No. Brilliant Coin uses a dynamic emission model, where tokens are minted as rewards for staking and participation. Emissions are tied to protocol growth not capped by an arbitrary limit.

## 🌐 What Chain Is Brilliant Coin On?

Brilliant Coin is deployed on Base, a fast, low-cost Ethereum Layer 2.

It provides secure, scalable infrastructure with deep ecosystem support and seamless access via MetaMask, Rabby, or Coinbase Wallet.

## 🫂 How Do Referrals Work?

When someone joins using your referral link and starts staking, you receive a share of their claimed rewards — paid out automatically across three tiers:

| Referral Level | You Earn |
|----------------|----------|
| Level 1 | 2.5% of claimed rewards |
| Level 2 | 1.5% |
| Level 3 | 1.0% |

Generate your link at **brilliantcoin.com** by connecting your wallet and clicking the Referral button. Copy, share, and earn.

## 🚫 Is There a Team Allocation or Presale

No. There was no presale, and 0% of the token supply is allocated to the team.

Instead, the Brilliant Coin team personally seeded the initial liquidity and covered all necessary deployment, audit, and infrastructure costs — ensuring a clean, transparent launch with no external funding or insider advantage.

No presale. No team tokens. Just a protocol built for the community, by contributors who believe in long-term value.
