A new class of digital asset for the next era of on-chain capital.

Brilliant Coin isn't just another DeFi token — it's a purpose-built protocol that rewards commitment, aligns incentives, and amplifies value.

Stakers earn rewards, referrals drive growth and earn from a 3 tiers referral system, and the APR dynamically scales — doubling every time TVL doubles.

## 🧭 How It Works

Brilliant Coin uses a TVL-scaling architecture that aligns protocol growth with user rewards.

- As TVL (Total Value Locked) increases, the APR doubles.
- Staking reduces the circulating supply, combined with organic demand from staking, creates upward pressure on the token price.
- As price and TVL rise together, so does the APR — attracting even more liquidity and compounding the system forward.

This creates a positive feedback loop:

**Higher TVL → Higher Price → Higher APR → More Staking → Even Higher TVL**

## ⚙️ What Powers the Brilliant System

- **📜 Smart-contract-based staking** with precision control
- **📈 A TVL-linked double-APR scaling model**
- **🤝 A 3-tier referral system** that rewards ecosystem growth
- **♻️ Compounding mechanisms** that turn participation into performance
- **⚡ One-click ZAP IN** for seamless onboarding — no friction, no clutter

Every stake, every compound, every referral feeds the upward engine.

## 📌 Key Mechanic — TL;DR

Each time protocol TVL doubles, the APR doubles with it.

Brilliant Coin isn't about memes or momentum.

It's about reviving what made DeFi magical: sky-high on-chain yields, built on transparent mechanics and shared upside.
